# Transplexer-Hyperscribe

Transplexer integration for Hyperscribe

## Overview

This library contains a set of functions that integrates
[transplexer](https://github.com/foxbunny/transplexer) with
[hyperscribe](https://github.com/foxbunny/hyperscribe), thus creating a
mechanism for reactive DOM updates. 

The goal of this library is to allow lightweight declarative, direct and
efficient DOM manupulation while keeping the runtime footprint relatively low.
